# Blood biomarker disease prediction

## Overview

Type II diabetes predictor
model I - risk prediction
model II - clinical screening <--- # supposed to be based on glucose, but maybe lipids?

## Features

## Data Set

NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) dataset from 2013-2014 (Kaggle)

## Methods

Main model: XGBoost  /// CURRENT ROC AUC: 0.833741887697517

Second (comparision) model: LightGBM

## Results

TODO --> consider SHAP equations

Check Shepley's values and explore the model research-style

## Usage

Install dependencies if needed:

``` bash
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install xgboost
pip install lightgbm
pip install seaborn
pip install matplotlib
pip install shap
```
